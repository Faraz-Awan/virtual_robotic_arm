# Virtual Robotic Arm

A 2D simulation of a 2-joint robotic arm that moves to a user-specified point using inverse kinematics. Built with Python and matplotlib.

## Goals
- Build a simple robotics project from scratch
- Visualize kinematics in action
- Improve robotics intuition through implementation
